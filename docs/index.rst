Astrometry.net Client Documentation
===================================

Welcome to the documentation for the Astrometry.net Client package. The package 
provides an extensive Python interface for the `Astrometry.net`_ API. Altough 
the reason for creating this packages is mainly for uploading files, it can
be used to interact with all api endpoints.

.. note:: 
   The documentation (much like the package) is still a work in progress, so
   there will be additions and refinements. However, most of the classes and
   methods are documented, and can be found at the :doc:`modules`
   page.

I am open to any suggested additions or feedback, so do not hesitate to open an
issue_.
